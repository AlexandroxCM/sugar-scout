    {
        restaurant: "Panda Express",
        warning: "Many dishes are breaded and fried before being tossed in sugary sauces. Even veggies can be glazed in sugar syrup.",
        tip: "Stick to 'Super Greens' and non-breaded options like Mushroom Chicken or Broccoli Beef. Avoid Orange Chicken and Sweet Fire Chicken."
    },
    {
        restaurant: "McDonald's",
        warning: "Ketchup and BBQ sauce contain surprising amounts of sugar. Buns are also high-carb.",
        tip: "Remove the bun to save ~28g of carbs. Mustard and mayonnaise are safer condiment choices than ketchup."
    },
    {
        restaurant: "Starbucks",
        warning: "The default syrup pumps are excessive (4 pumps for a Grande). Whipped cream adds calories but not much sugar—the syrup is the enemy.",
        tip: "Ask for 'sugar-free vanilla' or limit regular syrup to 1 pump. Heavy cream is a lower-carb milk substitute."
    },
    {
        restaurant: "Chipotle",
        warning: "The tortilla alone is ~50g of carbs. Rice handles vary, and heavy scoops can double your carb count.",
        tip: "Go for a bowl. Ask for 'light rice' or skip it for extra beans (fiber). Guacamole provides healthy fats to slow absorption."
    },
    {
        restaurant: "Pizza Places (General)",
        warning: "Crust thickness matters. Tomato sauce often has added sugar.",
        tip: "Thin crust has significantly fewer carbs. Load up on meat and veggie toppings to fill up on fewer slices."
    },
    {
        restaurant: "Subway/Jimmy John's",
        warning: "Bread is the main carb source. 'Honey Wheat' often has more sugar/carbs than white bread.",
        tip: "Turn any sub into a 'Tub' or 'Unwich' (lettuce wrap) to eliminate almost all the carbs."
    },
    {
        restaurant: "Dave's Hot Chicken",
        warning: "The 'Dave's Sauce' contains sugar, and sliders come on high-carb brioche buns. Milkshakes and Slushies are pure sugar.",
        tip: "Stick to tenders and ask for sauce on the side. Skip the bread slice that comes with the meal."
    },
    {
        restaurant: "Punjab Cafe (San Jose)",
        warning: "Rice, Naan, and fruit-based drinks like Mango Lassi cause massive glucose spikes. Many sauces use sugar for balance.",
        tip: "Prioritize protein-rich dishes like Tandoori Chicken. Saag (spinach) dishes are great fiber sources. Ask for 'No Sugar' in your Chai."
